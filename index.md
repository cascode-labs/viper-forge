# VIPER-FORGE

A community-led collection of circuit design [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) packages

Viper and viper-forge packages make it really easy to get started designing an integrated circuit.  The packages will be built for the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package and environment manager and hosted on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).

## Viper Packages

We're currently developing Conda build recipes for an initial set of projects to support on viper-forge.

## Viper environments

We're also developing a set of curated viper environments that are known to work.  These will be Conda environment definition yaml files containing the packages required by the environment.
